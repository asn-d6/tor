  o Major features (clients, onion services):
    - Clients and onion services now choose four long-lived
      "layer 2" guard relays for use as the middle hop in all onion circuits.
      These relays are kept in place for a randomized duration averaging 1
      week each. This mitigates guard discovery attacks against clients and
      short-lived onion services such as OnionShare. Long-lived onion
      services that need high security should still use the Vanguards addon
      (https://github.com/mikeperry-tor/vanguards). Closes ticket 40363.
