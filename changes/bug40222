  o Major features (metrics): - Introduce a new class of extra-info statistics
  that allows relays to expose details of how overloaded they are. This
  information is controlled using the OverloadStatistics torrc option, and it
  will be used to make more informed decisions about the network's load
  balancing. Implements proposal 328; closes ticket 40222.
